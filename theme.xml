There are multiple options available for the type of screen that you will be
using. Change the xml file to one of the following depending on what screen
you will be using.

template: 320x240.xml
4:3 ratio for screens with a 320x240 resolution. Ideal for a device like a
RetroPie Zero or GPi Case. This template is simplified and maximizes the usage
of the small screen.

template: 4x3.xml or 4x3-bezel.xml (CRT bezel over media)
4:3 ratio for screens with a 1024x768 resolution, but works well with 640x480,
800x600 etc. Ideal for things like CRT monitors. The text in this template is
too small for 320x240 screens.

template: 16x9.xml or 16x9-bezel.xml (CRT bezel over media)
16:9 ratio for screens with a 1280x720 resolution and larger. Ideal for most
flat panel TVs.

template: 16x10.xml or 16x10-bezel.xml (CRT bezel over media)
16:10 ratio for screens with a 1280x800 resolution or larger. Ideal for most
flat panel computer monitors.
