Clean is a simple, modern theme for Emulation Station and RetroPie with a minimal focus that is designed to work on a variety of screen sizes.

The theme supports resolutions from 320x240 and up. There are custom templates for different screen resolutions and you will want to customize the template based on the screen you plan to use. Many of the system logos are from the Carbon theme by Eric Hettervick with small tweaks to make them look nice on a black background.
